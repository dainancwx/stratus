      <h1>Welcome to STRATUS</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>STRATUS (Storm Tracking, Research, And Targeted U.S. Studies)</strong> is an atmospheric research and
        field deployment program focused on advancing severe weather observation, forecasting, and environmental analysis across the United States.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is to bridge the gap between meteorological science and real-world applications by developing
        field-ready technologies and providing open-access data for researchers, emergency management, and
        agricultural operations. STRATUS teams operate advanced sensor arrays, deploy mobile weather platforms, and
        analyze atmospheric data to better understand storm dynamics, wind structure, and local climate effects.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Focus Areas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>üî¨ Collaborative field projects and instrument testing</li>
        <li>üåæ Agricultural monitoring soil moisture, wind, and precipitation impacts</li>
        <li>üõ∞Ô∏è Real-time atmospheric data collection using ground and aerial platforms</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
        STRATUS is open to research collaboration and data sharing initiatives. Whether you‚Äôre part of a university,
        a government agency, or a private research group, we welcome partnerships that push atmospheric science forward.
